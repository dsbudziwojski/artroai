# ArtroAI

**Purpose**: This is our creative social media platform, where the main form of communication is through AI-generated art. Instead of traditional posts, users share moments, thoughts, and ideas by turning them into unique digital artwork. The app allows users to explore a dynamic gallery, interact with friends through whom they simply like, and experience daily life in a more expressive and visual way. Our goal is to make everyday sharing more imaginative, fun, and meaningful.

**Target Audience**: Teenagers & Young Adults 

**Technologies**: 
1. Frontend: ReactJS + TailWind (CSS)
2. Backend: NodeJS + Prisma PostgreSQL
3. API: GPT
4. Possible Optimizations: Typescript

## What is entails our "Art Gallery":
Prompt user to generate AI Art which entails (2) API calls:
1. Create the actual image based on the prompt provided:
2. Create hashtags from the prompt (which will be stored in addition to the username of prompter and name for searching purposes)
